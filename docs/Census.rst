Loading Census Data With Pandas Reporter
========================================

The general process for creating a census package is similar to the package process described in the `Getting Started tutoria, <https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/metatab-py/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.rst>`_ but with a ``DataFile`` term that uses a program to fetch data from Census Reporter. First we'll create the program, then link it into a Metatab package. The program uses the `pandas-reporter` module, so the reation process is very similar to the `Pandas-Reporter tutorial <https://github.com/CivicKnowledge/pandas-reporter/blob/master/test/Pandas%20Reporter%20Examples.ipynb>`_
